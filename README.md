# Machine Learning Algorithm for Estimating Tree Upgrowth, Mortality, and Stand Recruitment

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a machine learning-based algorithm to estimate key metrics related to forest dynamics:
- **Tree Upgrowth**: Change in tree width over time, indicating tree growth.
- **Tree Mortality**: Number of trees that have died within a defined stand over a specific period.
- **Stand Recruitment**: Number of new trees in a forest stand, indicating new growth or natural regeneration.

## Algorithm Components
1. **Data Collection**:
   - Collect historical data on tree width, tree mortality events, and stand recruitment from forest inventory records or remote sensing data.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Clean the data, handle missing values, and format it into a suitable structure for machine learning.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Extract relevant features such as tree age, environmental factors, stand density, and previous growth rates to train the model.

4. **Model Selection**:
   - Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machines, or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks based on the nature of the data and desired accuracy.

5. **Model Training**:
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Train the selected models using the training data, optimizing hyperparameters for performance.

6. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the trained models using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and R-squared to assess their accuracy in predicting tree upgrowth, mortality, and stand recruitment.
